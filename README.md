#### Description:
• In this project, I have built a ***web app*** (with assistance of David sir during my CS50x Course) which allows users to Login/Logout along with there passwords. And incase of wrong password user will redirect to *error page*.<br/>
• C$50 Finance, a web app via which you can manage portfolios of stocks. Not only will this tool allow you to check real stocks’ actual prices and portfolios’ values, it will also let you buy and sell stocks by querying IEX for stocks’ prices.<br/>
• I have added another functionality that allows users to ***change their passwords***.<br/>
• To see the current price of any stock, simply go to the **Quote** Tab and enter the stock symbol and hit enter. Current Price of that stock will be displayed.<br/>
• Now, you can **Buy** the stocks as much as your cash allows and in case of ***insufficent balance*** you will get an ***error***<br/>
• And in the case of **Sell**, user can sell the stocks that he has purchased by selecting from the drop-down list. And if the user trys to sell more stocks than the purchased one, you will get an ***error***<br/>
• At last, In the **History** tab user can see history of all the stocks bought or sold at what price. Where **-** (negative) shares are use to represent ***sold***.
